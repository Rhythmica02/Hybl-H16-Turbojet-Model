# 🛠️ Hybl Turbines H16 Turbojet Engine | 3D CAD Model

This repository contains a high-fidelity 3D CAD model of the **Hybl Turbines H16 turbojet engine**, designed using **Autodesk Fusion 360**. The model replicates the mechanical design and external features of the real-world H16 engine, used in RC jet aircraft. The objective of this project is to demonstrate CAD proficiency, attention to detail, and design understanding of aerospace-grade propulsion systems.
